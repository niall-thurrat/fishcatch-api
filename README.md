### Introduction: the problem I have tried to solve

The FishCatch API is dedicated to helping anglers record their caugth fish. This is the idea suggested by course responsibles, as follows. 

-- --------------
The fishing club "Den svartmunnade sm√∂rbultens banne" needs an API for collection fishing reports. They are thinking of building a client application but want a separate web API before taking this process along. The idea is that fishers should be able to report their catch and that this data could be made public. They want to collect data like:

The user which catches the fish
* The position (longitude and latitude) of the catch
* Specie of the fish
* Weight
* Length
* Timestamp of the catch

To do un-safe HTTP calls, the API must have Authentication/Authorization. A user should be able to sign in through the API in a safe way.

### QUESTION 1
Explain and defend your implementation of HATEOAS in your solution.

### ANSWER 1
I have chosen to use HAL as my hypermedia format to implement HATEOAS. My decision was largely based on the fact that I wanted something lightweight that was not just machine readable but quite easy to read for developers. I really like the syntax which has properties representing resource state, followed by links and embedded resources which conform to the HAL standards. I have included a 'description' property in each response which gives a bit of info about the recived resource and what options are now available to the client developer. This is just for easier 'at-a-glance' reading and is not actually needed. The 'rel' links of links inspired me to create some basic documentation which is served up by the API (e.g. https://api.host/docs/rels/user) and related to my more ad-hoc links. While maintenance of these docs could be troublesome and it adds dev time to the project, I think it really helps make the API more discoverable to developers.

### QUESTION 2
If your solution should implement multiple representations of the resources. How would you do it?

### ANSWER 2
This would be acheived with content negotiation. At present my API only serves up Content Type application/hal+json, but I could also configure it to serve representations with other content types such as XML. I guess I would have to let developers know in the documentation that other options are available. Clients could then use the Accept header to specify which content type they prefer to receive. An npm package such as jsontoxml would enable me to convert my current json response bodies into xml. I'm not sure exactly how this would be coded, but each different representation would probably have a different URI, and requests would be routed based on the Accept header.

### QUESTION 3
Motivate and defend your authentication solution.
1. What other authentication solutions could you implement?
2. What pros/cons do this solution have?

### QUESTION 4
Explain how your webhook works.

### ANSWER 4

### QUESTION 5
Since this is your first own web API, there are probably things you would solve in another way, looking back at this assignment. Write your thoughts about this.

### ANSWER 5
bla

### QUESTION 6
Did you do something extra besides the fundamental requirements? Explain them.

### ANSWER 6
Not really, I pretty much stuck to the suggested problem in the brief. I also omitted images from the fishCatchModel due to time constraints. This
